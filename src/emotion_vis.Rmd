## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
#讀檔
 library(readr)
 emotion <- read.csv("emotion_top10.csv", encoding = "UTF-8" )

#資料篩選-a
 library(dplyr)
 emotion_a <- emotion %>%
   filter(new_df_select_category1 == "a") 
#資料篩選-v
 library(dplyr)
 emotion_v <- emotion %>%
   filter(new_df_select_category1 == "v")
#資料篩選-n
 library(dplyr)
 emotion_n <- emotion %>%
   filter(new_df_select_category1 == "n") 
#視覺化-a
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = emotion_a)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = word, y = num, fill = sentiment), stat = "identity" )
#視覺化-v
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = emotion_v)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = word, y = num, fill = sentiment), stat = "identity" )
#視覺化-n
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(data = emotion_n)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(x = word, y = num, fill = sentiment), stat = "identity" )
